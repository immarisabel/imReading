About how no one is exempt from mistakes and tragedy and that should not hold us from enjoying life, the way May always did. It feels May was the embodiment of the resolution. A clean slate for the family. Enjoying life, and not caring about the past, but about moving forward.</span></div></div><div><br></div>','2022-02-15 00:00:00','üôÇ',352,1),

The whole idea felt like poetry to me. Like a concept, displayed in the whole book. Unable to explain it without having to read the book. The owl was the symbolism for stories and wisdom accross the ages. The evolution of Seymor was perfect. He wanted to give something back to the children he took Zeno from. So he gave them the books, single enditions. Hence they are not in Atlas. Though that part was weird. He was in charge of Atlas and the book was not there? That does not make sense. But I loved the second half of the book. I am glad I dragged through the first. Ana and Omeir‚Äôs story sound super similar to ‚ÄúAll the Lights we cannot see‚Äù."</span></div></div>','2022-04-03 00:00:00',NULL,626,54),

The kind of writing style which drags you, word y word, filling every inch of your lungs, until it leaves you breathless. For a moment, I wanted Luc to be real, real love, for a moment, I believed he was. And even with that ending, I still wish, part of me hopes, he still is. Even though realistically, he‚Äôs not. And I guess that was the whole point, that was the enchantment Schwab instilled upon us with her beautiful, calculated prose. She bewitched us into thinking it was possible. And even though I root for Addie to win, part of me feels bad for Luc. And that is why this was such a good story.</span></div></div>','2022-03-28 00:00:00',NULL,560,52),
